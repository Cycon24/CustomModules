Discovered Observations:
For supersonic flow in a duct where L/D < Lmax/D
    - The flow will remain supersonic if Pe > Pb assuming no shock occurs
        - A constant regime, resistant to Î”Pb as long as Pe > Pb
    - As Pe increases, as shock will form at the exit plane first
        - A shock at the exit plane will produce the lowest Pe for this duct
    - As Pe increases further, it will reach max Pe for shock in duct
        - A shock at the inlet plane will produce the highest Pe for this duct 
        (without affecting conditions before duct)
    - As Pe increases even more, the conditions prior to the inlet will be affected
        - This could result in:
            1: A shock forming in geometry upstream (a CD nozzle for example)
            2: A mass flow reduction 
        - Determining which  happens will require  knowing upstream information
            1: If CD nozzle is upstream of duct, the shock will move from CD 
            exit plane towards the throat in a manner that will ensure Pe=Pb for
            the duct.
            2: If the Pb increases further, the nozzle will unchoke and mass flow
            rate will decrease.
            
    Therefore, we find a few regimes by looking at changing back pressure:
        1. 0 <= Pb < Pe1 found assuming no shock and supersonic flow through entire duct
            - changes in Pb  will not affect the conditions in the duct at all
            - flow is under-expanded and expansion fans will exist
            on duct outlet
            
        2. Pb = Pe1
            - flow is fully expanded, no shock or expansion waves
            
        3. Pe1 < Pb < Pe2 from a normal shock at the exit of the duct 
            - the flow is over-expanded and obliue shock waves will form at the
            end of the duct, as Pb -> Pe2, they become stronger and closer to a 
            normalshock
            
        4. Pb = Pe2
            - a normal shock exists at the exit of the duct
            - No fanno flow occurs after shock
            
        5. Pe2 < Pb < Pe3 found from assuming a normal shock at duct inlet
            - a shock will form somewhere in the duct
            - the shock will form so that Pe_duct = Pb
        
        6. Pb = Pe3
            - a normal shock exists at the inlet of the duct
            
        7. Pe3 < Pb
            - The shock moves upstream of the duct and either:
                1. Shocks in upstream geometry
                2. Unchokes the flow and decreases mass flow rate
'''
'''
Discovered Observations:
For supersonic flow in a duct where L/D < Lmax/D
 - A shock must form somewhere in the duct so that the flow 
 at the exit is sonic
 - If Pb > Pe for sonic condition, the shock will move towards
 the inlet of the duct
 - A shock at the inlet of the duct generates the highest exit
 pressure and the lowest exit mach number
 
So the flow regimes are:
    1. 0 < Pb < Pe1 found by iteration for Me = 1
        - the pressure change will not change the location of 
        the shock
    2. Pb = Pe1 
        - the shock is still at the location producing the
    shock condition at exit
    3. Pe1 < Pb < Pe2 found by assuming shock at the duct inlet
        - The shock will form somewhere between the inlet and
        the shock location to satisfy Me = 1
        - The exit Mach number will be subsonic
        - Increases in the back pressure will move the duct further
        backwards
        - Location of shock found through iteration to satisfy Pe=Pb
    4. Pb = Pe2 
        - The shock forms at the inlet of the duct
    5. Pe2 < Pb
        - The shock moves upstream of the duct and either:
            1. Shocks in upstream geometry
            2. Unchokes the flow and decreases mass flow rate
